# Data wrangling

## Introduction

In this notebook we will be using a transcriptomics dataset of ColoRectal Cancer (CRC). CRC has four different subtypes (CMS1, CMS2, CMS3 and CMS4) that it can be classified to (you can read more about it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3967)). Our objective is to train a machine learning model to classify a CRC sample into the four subtypes.

We will go through a checklist of the main tasks to do before embarking in any machine learning process. This includes:

- Sample QC
- Normalization
- Scaling
- Batch correction
- Dealing with missing values
- Quick ML model example
