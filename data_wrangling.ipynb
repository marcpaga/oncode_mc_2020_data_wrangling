    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Good models in machine learning require high quality data. Otherwise happens what we call *garbage in, garbage out*. Furthermore, prediction models need standardized data; otherwise the trained model will only work for the same particular set of data that was used for training. For these reasons, the first steps in machine learning are composed of data exploration and quality control; and are crucial to ensure that all the downstream tasks are not doomed from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using a transcriptomics dataset of ColoRectal Cancer (CRC). CRC has four different subtypes (CMS1, CMS2, CMS3 and CMS4) that it can be classified to (you can read more about it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3967)). Our objective is to train a machine learning model to classify a CRC sample into the four subtypes. For example, this would be useful if different subtypes receive different treatments, and we want to make sure that a new patient gets the best treatment possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through a checklist of the main tasks to do before embarking in any machine learning process. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample QC\n",
    "- Normalization\n",
    "- Scaling\n",
    "- Batch correction\n",
    "- Dealing with missing values\n",
    "- Quick ML model example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about two characteristics about the data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type of data**: in this case it is microarray data, but for other types of data (RNA-sequencing, metabolomics mass-spectrometry, proteomics mass-spectrometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, genomics, ...), although the core concepts of quality control and data standardization are applicable, the method to apply these concepts can be entirely different.\n",
    "- **Experiment design**: even within the same type of data, the design of the experiment will define which are the better or worse approaches to work with the data. It is not the same to do full proteome than to do a IP proteomics. When designing an experiment that will be mostly analyzed by bioinformatics it is extremely important to also include such bioinformatics analysis in the design process: *will I be able to properly normalize the data with the included samples? Do I have enough replicates? Should I include another sample to control for non-specific binding?* Bioinformatics does not do miracles for poorly designed experiments.\n",

For this reason, it is important to check if we see any of these effects on the data. But even more important, is to know if we should expect these effects since we have designed and performed the experiment. And even if we have not done the experiment personally, we should know how it has been done and what is its design.\n",

In the plots, each dot is a sample, similar samples will be together in the 2D space; and different samples will be separated. Keep in mind that these 2 dimensions are a subset of all the data, which means that although two samples might seem far away in a dimension they might be close in another dimension. PCAs are also ordered by the amount of variance that they explain, therefore PC1 will show the most variance, then PC2, PC3...\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Why are not the different CMS subtypes not perfectly clustered together even after normalization and batch correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling is also part of the normalization process. Scaling can be done on the samples and/or on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling of the samples is done to make datasets compatible. If one dataset is in log2 scale, but the other is in log10 scale they are not compatible because the same feature will have significant different ranges depending on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature importance. It is important that features are all in a similar (if not the same) scale. For example, before we calculated the Euclidean distance, in it we calculated the difference between expression of genes. Let's consider that a geneA goes from expression of 1 to 1.2; in the same sample geneB goes from 0.1 to 0.2. geneB has quite a change in gene expression because it is doubled between samples; while geneA has a 20% increase. In Euclidean space now the difference is 0.2 and 0.1, making the change in expression of geneA the larger one. Therefore consider, for your particular experiment, which features should be the important ones, if there should be any at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we already had the data a scaled a bit since we are working with log transformed values. Therefore making genes with really high expression less valuable compared to lower expressed genes. But we might consider scaling all the genes between 0-1, so that we only compare relative expression between samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scaling methods, this [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-7-142) has a nice table with several scaling methods that can be used.\n",

    "# Dealing with missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values are quite common and it is important to understand why they exist in our dataset. Again, consider the type of data and the experiment design when thinking about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing completely at random**: as the name indicates, these are values that you did not measure because of bad luck. Perhaps the probe was defective, the peptide did not fly well in the mass spec, etc.\n",
    "- **Missing not at random**: these are values that are missing because of a reason. For example, the method has a limit of detection and this feature was below it. That does not mean that for example, the gene is not expressed, but rather we do not have the technology to detect its low level of expression. It could also be that the gene is actually not expressed at all because of a condition of the experiment. Or a metabolite is not detected because of the extraction method.\n",
    "- **Missing because of the data processing**: these should be quite easily detectable. These are actually values that we had measured at some point and that became missing because of some processing step. For example, we tried to take the log of a negative number or calculate the mean of a set that contained a `NA` value. It is important to always check our data before and after each processing step, and make sure that everything is as we expect it to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of missing values, it is crucial to be able to differentiate between them whenever possible since the methods that are used to deal with each type are different. Sadly, most of the times we have a combination of these different types and it can be difficult to confidently tell which on is which. \n",
    "\n",
    "In R missing values are usually denoted as `NA`, but it might be different in other platforms. Consider also if `0` is a missing value or means that it was not truly measured.\n",
    "\n",
